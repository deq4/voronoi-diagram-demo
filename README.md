# [Demo](https://deq4.github.io/voronoi-diagram-demo/)

A crude interactive demo of the [Fortune's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune's_algorithm)
for calculating a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).

Note: this demo doesn't use proper data structures for storing the event queue and the beach line and has arrays instead.
